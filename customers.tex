\section{Primary Customers}
As Airbus produce more than just commercial aircraft, this means they have a variety of main customers and clients. For passenger planes, an example of a client would be an airline looking to purchase a new aircraft for their fleet. One such customer -- All Nippon Airways -- purchased three A380s to fly their Tokyo-Honolulu route in 2018 \parencite{ana2018}.
For defense, Airbus' main clients are military comapanies whereas for space, the main clients are typically organisations where their primary goal involves space, such as the NASA example discussed previously. Airbus sell a variety of different helicopters, for corporate, civil and defense purposes. This means that these clients can vary too. A recent example is the Hungarian Ministry of Defence. According to \cite{budapest2018}, they purchased 16 additional military helicopters from Airbus in 2018.
